The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

However, this data has only basic features like 'tweet_id','dog_name','retweet_id' etc. Some important features like the number of retweets and number of favorites (which show the popularity of the dog) were not provided. Luckily, with the given tweet_id's, we can wrangle this tweets from WeRateDog's archive and extract the required content.<br><br>\n",
